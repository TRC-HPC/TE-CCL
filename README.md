# TE-CCL

TE-CCL is a tool to generate collective communication schedules for large topologies using a Traffic Engineering-based solver.

TE-CCL takes in a topology and collective (e.g. AllGather) and outputs a schedule (in JSON) detailing data transfer steps for each node that satisfies the demands specified by the collective. In a Traffic Engineering-based approach, TE-CCL encodes the collective communication process into *capacity constraints*, *flow conservation constraints*, and *destination constraints*, and solves a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), with options to convert to an linear program (LP) form or A* form for better scalibility.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and activate an anaconda environment.
- Obtain and install a [Gurobi license](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/). After getting the license, follow the steps to install and activate Gurobi.
```
conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/gurobi
conda install -c conda-forge gurobi -y
<command to install Gurobi license. e.g. grbgetkey xxxxxx>
```
### Install TE-CCL
In the anaconda environment with Gurobi installed, run
```
pip install .
```

## Usage
TE-CCL takes in a JSON user input file that specifies the topology, Gurobi settings, and model instance parameters. Please refer to [Input Data](#input-data) for details.
```
teccl solve --input_args <input.json>
```

### Example
To generate a schedule for AllGather in the NDv2 topology, run
```
teccl solve --input_args teccl/examples/sample_inputs/ndv2_input.json
```
This will generate the schedule file `teccl/examples/schedules/ndv2_schedule.json`

### Detailed Examples
For detailed examples, please refer to instructions in the [examples](teccl/examples/) directory.

### Hardware and Resource Requirements
Simple topologies (like the example above) can be easily solved using a laptop within seconds. Larger topologies (like 4-chassis ones provided in our `examples` directory) need 256GB RAM and 1+ hours. 


## Input Data
A user input JSON file is consists of three parts: `TopologyParams`, `GurobiParams`, and `InstanceParams`. Detailed explainations of each argument is in [input_data.py](teccl/input_data.py).

### TopologyParams
This sepcifies the topology considered. Each topology is defined as a seperate Python file in teccl/topologies.

### GurobiParams
Parameters for the Gurobi solver.

### InstanceParams
Parameters for the model instance, including the collective, the choice of objective function and size of epochs.
